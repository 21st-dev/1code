# [PROJECT NAME] Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: [DATE]

**NOTE**: This file provides runtime development guidance. For constitutional rules and core principles, see `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

## Core Principles (Reference)

The following principles from the constitution guide all development work:

1. **Desktop-First Experience** - Offline-first, native APIs, local data
2. **Git Worktree Isolation** (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - Every chat in isolated worktree
3. **Type Safety & Data Integrity** - Strict TypeScript, Zod validation, Drizzle migrations
4. **User Transparency & Control** - Real-time feedback, diff previews, actionable errors
5. **Performance & Responsiveness** - No UI blocking, streaming, proper memoization

See constitution for detailed rules and rationale.
