# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with `/specify/memory/constitution.md`:

**Principle I - Desktop-First Experience**:
- [ ] Feature works offline-first with local data storage
- [ ] Uses native Electron APIs where applicable (dialogs, notifications, etc.)
- [ ] IPC uses type-safe tRPC patterns
- [ ] State persists across app restarts
- [ ] Platform-specific features degrade gracefully

**Principle II - Git Worktree Isolation** (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- [ ] Feature respects worktree boundaries (does not bypass isolation)
- [ ] If modifying worktree logic: includes cleanup on chat deletion
- [ ] If modifying worktree logic: blocks agent mode on creation failure

**Principle III - Type Safety & Data Integrity**:
- [ ] All tRPC routers have Zod input schemas
- [ ] Database changes use Drizzle migrations only (no manual SQL)
- [ ] No `any` types without explicit justification
- [ ] Preload APIs are fully typed

**Principle IV - User Transparency & Control**:
- [ ] Tool executions render in real-time
- [ ] Changes show diff previews before applying
- [ ] Error messages are actionable with recovery suggestions
- [ ] Background operations show progress and allow cancellation

**Principle V - Performance & Responsiveness**:
- [ ] Operations >100ms run in background/workers
- [ ] Large files stream (not loaded entirely into memory)
- [ ] Database queries use indexes, avoid N+1 patterns
- [ ] React components properly memoized

**Development Standards**:
- [ ] Testing strategy defined (integration/E2E/unit as needed)
- [ ] Follows code organization patterns (file naming, module structure)
- [ ] Uses conventional commit format

**If any checks fail**: Document in Complexity Tracking table with justification

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
